          <ol>
            <li>
              The Respondent is the person or organization you say
              discriminated. Usually, there is only one.
            </li>
            <li>
              Usually the Respondent is an organization such as: corporate
              employer or landlord, government body, service provider, business
              or union. Organizations are usually responsible for their
              employees’ actions. Make the organization Respondent #1.
            </li>
            <li>
              An individual can be a Respondent. Only name the person who you
              say discriminated against you. For example, name the person who
              harassed you. Do not name the person who only handed you a letter
              firing you.

              Email:
            </b>
            Email is fastest. If possible, give an email address where we can
            send your complaint. Choose someone that you think has authority to
            respond to your complaint. For example, someone in the human
            resources, or legal department.

            <b>
              Please note:
            </b>
            The Tribunal cannot reject someone’s complaint because they don’t
            have an email address for the Respondent. They must have an address
            but it does not need to be an email.

              The complainant has a disability that prevented them from filing

            <li>
              The complainant faced trauma or a family or housing crisis that

            against someone who makes a complaint or might make a complaint

          <li></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Retaliation is conduct that punishes someone for their involvement in

        <ul>
          <li>
            evicting
