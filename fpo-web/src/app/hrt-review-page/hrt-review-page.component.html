          <ol>
            <li>
              The Respondent is the person or organization you say
              discriminated. Usually, there is only one.
            </li>
            <li>
              Usually the Respondent is an organization such as: corporate
              employer or landlord, government body, service provider, business
              or union. Organizations are usually responsible for their
              employees’ actions. Make the organization Respondent #1.
            </li>
            <li>
              An individual can be a Respondent. Only name the person who you
              say discriminated against you. For example, name the person who
              harassed you. Do not name the person who only handed you a letter
              firing you.

              Email:
            </b>
            Email is fastest. If possible, give an email address where we can
            send your complaint. Choose someone that you think has authority to
            respond to your complaint. For example, someone in the human
            resources, or legal department.

            <b>
              Please note:
            </b>
            The Tribunal cannot reject someone’s complaint because they don’t
            have an email address for the Respondent. They must have an address
            but it does not need to be an email.

        <p>
          The Tribunal will review your complaint. Next, it will tell you one of
          the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            the complaint form is complete and the complaint will proceed to the
            next step. The Tribunal will send a copy to the Respondent(s)
          </li>
          <li>
            the complaint form is incomplete and the Tribunal will ask you for
            more information by a certain date
          </li>
          <li>
            the complaint is on hold until the end of another proceedings
          </li>
          <li>
            the complaint cannot be accepted for filing because:
            <ul>
              <li>
                the complaint is not covered by the BC Human Rights Code
              </li>
              <li>
                the complaint does not set out facts that could be
                discrimination under the BC Human Rights Code
              </li>
              <li>
                the complaint was filed late and the Tribunal has decided not to
                accept it.

          Protection from retaliation
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Human Rights Code forbids retaliation:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            against someone who makes a complaint or might make a complaint
          </li>
          <li>
            against someone who might get involved in a complaint. This includes
            parties, witnesses, or anyone who might help with a complaint.
          </li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Retaliation is conduct that punishes someone for their involvement in
          a complaint. It includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            evicting
          </li>
          <li>
            firing or suspending
          </li>
          <li>
            expelling or kicking out
          </li>
          <li>
            intimidating
          </li>
          <li>
            penalizing
          </li>
          <li>
            other similar kinds of harm
          </li>
        </ul>
